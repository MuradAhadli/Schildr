truction team.

My name is Alvaro and I am the GM of the Room Mate Grace Hotel. We have a p=
ool area that would like to separate from the rest of the mezzanine by clos=
ing the area with glass.

We would like to get a proposal so we can present it to our building owners=
.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Thank you.
